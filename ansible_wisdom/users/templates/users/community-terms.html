                            The Tech Preview gives access to a pre-release version of the ECS. The ECS is intended to
                            use an AI model to create Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content, and share related
                            data and information regarding such usage to train and improve the ECS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestions by ECS:</span> Based on your request,
                            the ECS will provide suggested Ansible tasks and other Ansible materials (“Suggestions”). By
                            using the ECS, you agree that any and all Suggestions and any User data input into ECS may
                            be used by International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) and its affiliates including
                            Red Hat, Inc. (“Red Hat”), for any purpose without limitation, including to further improve
                            and train the ECS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model used to
                            provide the ECS. The Suggestions will likely require modifications by User. User should
                            evaluate whether Suggestions are appropriate for User environments. User’s use of
                            Suggestions is at User’s discretion and risk. Any User requests or input into ECS will not
                            be treated as confidential information.

                            We are excited that you are interested in participating in this Technical Preview Program
                            (<strong>“Program”</strong>) and as a benefit, receiving access to Red Hat’s preview service
                            that provides guidance on Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content (<strong>“Lightspeed”</strong>)
                            integrated with IBM’s Early Cloud Service for IBM watsonx Code Assistant (<strong>"ECS"</strong>)
                            (subject to a separate IBM agreement). The Program gives you access to a preview version of
                            Lightspeed at no cost subject to these terms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These Program Terms govern your use of Lightspeed and are subject to the Red Hat Enterprise
                            Agreement available at<a href="http://www.redhat.com/agreements">http://www.redhat.com/agreements</a>
                            (the<strong>"Agreement"</strong>). When we use a capitalized term without defining it in
                            these Program Terms, the term has the meaning defined in the Agreement. If there is a
                            conflict between these Program Terms and the Agreement, the Program Terms will take
                            precedence. IBM is not a party to the Agreement or these Program Terms.

                        <p>
                            The Program gives access to a preview version of Lightspeed. Lightspeed passes your requests
                            to ECS and uses output from ECS to refine Ansible tasks and other Ansible related content.
                            Red Hat shares that data and related information regarding such usage with IBM to train and
                            improve Lightspeed and ECS. Lightspeed is not supported for or intended for any other
                            purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use Lightspeed, you need to install the Ansible Visual Studio Code extension and
                            authenticate via your GitHub account that you have been authorized to use for this Program.
                            Based on your request, Lightspeed will provide suggested tasks or other Ansible related
                            materials (<strong>"Suggestions"</strong>). By participating in this Program you agree that
                            any and all Suggestions and any data associated with your use, may be used by Red Hat and
                            Red Hat’s affiliated companies, including IBM, for any purpose including to further improve
                            and train Lightspeed and ECS. The following information is collected and may be shared with
                            IBM:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The VS Code extension provides prompts and context to create Suggestions, and user
                                interactions with Suggestions such as acceptance, modification or rejection.</li>
                            <li>Lightspeed collects telemetry including Suggestions generated by ECS and refined by
                                post-processing rules, as well as operational information (e.g. service errors and
                                response times).</li>
                            <li>User feedback regarding user sentiment and recommendations.</li>

                        <p>
                            Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model. The
                            Suggestions will likely require additional modifications by you to be useful. Suggestions
