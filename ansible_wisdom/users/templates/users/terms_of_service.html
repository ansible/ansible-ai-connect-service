                        <p>
                            We are excited that you are interested in participating in this Private Preview Program
                            (<strong>“Program”</strong>) and as a benefit, receiving access to Project Wisdom Service
                            (the <strong>“Service”</strong>).
                            The Program allows you to use the Service at no cost subject to these terms. This Service
                            includes International Business Machines Corporation’s (<strong>“IBM”</strong>) AI models
                            and software.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These Program Terms govern your use of the Services and are subject to the Red Hat
                            Enterprise Agreement available at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/agreements">http://www.redhat.com/agreements</a>
                            (collectively the
                            <strong>"Agreement"</strong>). When we use a capitalized term without defining it in these
                            Program Terms, the
                            term has the meaning defined in the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement. If there is a conflict
                            between these Program Terms and the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement, the Program Terms will
                            take precedence.

                            The Program gives access to a preview version of the Service. The Service uses an AI model
                            to create Ansible tasks, playbooks and other Ansible related content, and shares that data
                            and related information regarding such usage to train and improve the Service. The Service
                            is not supported for or intended for any other purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use the Service, you need to install the Ansible Visual Studio Code extension and
                            authenticate via your GitHub account that you have been authorized to use with the Service.
                            Based on your request, the Service will provide suggested tasks, playbooks or other Ansible
                            related materials (<strong>"Suggestions"</strong>). By using the Service, you agree that any
                            and all
                            Suggestions and any data associated with the Service, may be used by Red Hat and Red Hat’s
                            affiliated companies, including IBM, for any purpose including to further improve and train

                        <p>
                            Suggestions may be similar to material used to train the machine learning model used to
                            provide the Service. The Suggestions will likely require additional modifications by you to
                            be useful. Suggestions are not considered Red Hat Software and Red Hat does not claim any
                            intellectual property rights with respect to any Suggestions. Your use of Suggestions is at
