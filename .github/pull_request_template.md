## Backport Policy

This change should be:
- [ ] **Not backported** - main/master only
- [ ] **Backported** to specific releases (add labels after merge)

### Automated Backport Instructions

**After this PR is merged**, add one or more labels to automatically create backport PRs:

- `backport/stable-2.4` - Backport to stable-2.4 branch
- `backport/stable-2.5` - Backport to stable-2.5 branch
- `backport/stable-2.6` - Backport to stable-2.6 branch
- `backport/all` - Backport to all active stable branches
- `no-backport` - Explicitly mark as not needing backport

### Backport Justification
<!-- Required if backporting. Explain why this needs to be in older releases -->
<!-- Examples: -->
<!-- - Critical bug affecting production -->
<!-- - Security vulnerability fix (include CVE if applicable) -->
<!-- - Regression introduced in X.Y.Z -->
<!-- - Customer-blocking issue -->
<!-- - Data corruption/loss prevention -->

**Special backport considerations:**
<!-- Any conflicts, dependencies, or modifications needed for backport -->
<!-- Will this apply cleanly to older releases? -->
<!-- Does this depend on other commits that also need backporting? -->

### Scenarios tested
<!-- Describe the scenarios you've already manually verified, if applicable. -->

## Production deployment
<!-- Check the appropriate box. Document any pre-reqs, co-reqs, secrets, configmaps, etc that need to be considered or prepared ahead of a deployment to production. Include links to any related PRs, e.g. in ansible-wisdom-ops. -->
