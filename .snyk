        reason: |
          ansible-wisdom-service doesn't currently use the
          vulnerable component 'joblib.numpy_pickle::NumpyArrayWrapper'
          We don't use joblib internally and the severity of the issue is challenged
          by the lib maintainer because NumpyArrayWrapper is not a public class.
