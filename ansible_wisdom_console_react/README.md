# Ansible Lightspeed Console UI

> **Warning:** `package.json homepage` setting.
>
> The `homepage` variable is set to `static/console` to replicate deployment within Django that uses its `static` loader mechanism to expose resources on the `<root>/static` context. The React Console UI is further exposed on the `console` leaf.  This allows a separation of Django and React applications.
>
> Change it at your peril!
